// Function Expression :
//      A function expression is very similar to and has almost same syntax as a function declaration.
//      The main difference between a function expression and a function declearation is the function name, which can be omitted in function expression to create anonymous function.

const variable = function(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
    return something
}

// Square of a number :
const square = function (num) {
    return num * num;
}
console.log(square(4));
